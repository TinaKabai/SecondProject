# SecondProject
This is a Collection project which consists of a list, set and map. I created an Array consisting a list of names and tested if the names expected math the acual one.
For the set class I created an Array consisting items representing my identity, and tested if the expected items match the acual ones.
There is also an interface with a method to collect items in the List and Set classes.
Because a Map interface is not part of the Colection interface, it behaves a bit different from the rest of the collection types. So in this project I used the keys to reference the values that are next to them. I then tested that the expected keys and values are not the same as the actual ones.
